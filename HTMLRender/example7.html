<body>

This is HTML your program should tokenize and render.
Be sure not to go over 80 characters on a line or the
text will go to the right and I will have to
scroll the window.

<P>Handling paragraphs
  even if they are different
            lines.</P><p> This new
 paragraph starts in middle of the line.
 </p>
 
 Here comes a horizontal rule
 <HR>
 
 Here comes a break.<br>Then break with punctuation!<br>

Start with plain text, then <i>italic words</i>
and <B>bold statements</B>.

<p><b>We can have bold paragraphs too, that run on for
a while and will have to go to the next line if it gets
too long.</b></p>
<br><p>we want
to have <i>italic
statements that could go to the next line, since
lines can get long and need to wrap-around
several times</i>.</p>

Of course, we quote <q>Mr Greenstein</q> briefly.

Before a comment?<!--Here is a comment
on several lines
that ends here.--> Yes! And outside again!

<br>
Now for something new!!!!
<H1>H1 Huge header ;-)</h1>
<h2>H2 Large header :-)</H2>
<h3>H3 Bold header that goes on and on
from one line, to the other, without any stopping; we could stop but
I want to test the length of the line.
</h3>
<h4>H4 Bold medium header ;-)</h4>
<h5>H5 Bold small header!!!</h5>
<h6>H6 Bold tiny header?!?</h6>

Let us try some numbers:
<br>
345, -198, 4e02, 4.32e2, and -1.543e-23
<br>
Do not forget preformatted text starting here.<br>
<pre>
    public static Scanner openToRead(String fileName) {
        Scanner input = null;
        try {
            input = new Scanner(new File(fileName));
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.err.println("ERROR: Cannot open " + fileName + " for reading.");
            System.exit(-1);
        }
        return input;
    }
</pre>

This     is 	the		 end 	of		 the file()</body>
